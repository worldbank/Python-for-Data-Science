# Python for Data Science
# Week 1 - Intro to Python
### Overview
Today we'll introduce the basics of Python. We will start with declaring variables and handling different data types, then conclude with a short intro to loops and conditionals.

### Resources
Please work through the [Learn The Basics](http://learnpython.org/) section on LearnPython.org before coming to class. Alternatively, pick one of the comparable learning resources (eg. Python 101 on CodeAcademy) that covers the same ground.

Optional:
* chapters 1-2 of [Think Python](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/thinkpython2.pdf)
* short tutorial on [markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/).
