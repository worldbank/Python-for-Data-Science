# Python_for_Data_Science
Spring 2019 course

# Overview
This course is for World Bank staff who need data science methods for their analytical or operational work. The instructors are Nick Jones (GFDRR Labs), Charles Fox (GOST) and Dharana Rijal (DEC).

__Objectives__: (i) expand the cohort of Bank staff with intermediate-level Python skills; (ii) contribute to quality of WB operations and analysis through increased uptake of data science methods; and (iii) expand the internal user base for World Bank APIs and code libraries.

__Prerequisites and format__: No prior coding experience is needed. The sessions will comprise short lecture-style teaching by the instructors, a 'lab' session where participants write code on their own laptops, and 'show and tell' sessions where an experienced Python user shows an example of their work through a code demonstration.

__Participant outcomes__: With no coding knowledge before the course, participants should be able to access and combine a diverse set of datasets, conduct data exploration and visualization, utilize Python libraries for geospatial data and machine learning, and be able to self-teach next steps in their specialized domain.

# Project work
To gain credit, participants are required to submit a final project. The format is a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook should ingest, analyze and visualize data using Python, to address a business need of the participant's unit. Short 'project clinic' sessions will be held on May 2 and May 16 to provide support (eg. identifying relevant libraries to address specific project needs).

# Schedule
The course meets on Thursdays at 3.30pm - 5.00pm.
